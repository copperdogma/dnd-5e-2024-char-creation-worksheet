## Test Completion Summary

### Test Scenario
- Created a High Elf Wizard with Sage background
- Focus on choice sequencing and dependency tracking
- Tested interaction between overlapping choice sources
- Verified space allocation and layout consistency

### Key Findings

1. Choice Dependencies
   - Multiple interconnected decisions need clearer sequencing:
     * Ability scores affect class requirements and spell calculations
     * Proficiency choices from multiple sources need coordination
     * Spell selections from three sources require planning
   - Current layout doesn't clearly show choice prerequisites
   - Need better "Future Impacts" tracking after each choice

2. Space Utilization
   - Current sections exceed specified space allocations:
     * Background section exceeds 1/3 page target
     * Species section needs consolidation
     * Final calculations need more efficient layout
   - Need to focus on essential choice tracking only
   - Remove non-essential details that don't affect other choices

3. Choice Recording Format
   - Inconsistent checkbox usage across sections
   - Varying formats for similar types of choices
   - Need standardized approach to:
     * Option selection
     * Source tracking
     * Dependency notation
     * Future impacts

4. Process Flow
   - Choice sequence needs clearer structure
   - Prerequisites not clearly indicated
   - Some choices could be deferred but timing not noted
   - Dependencies between sections need better visualization

### Recommendations

1. Structure Improvements
   - Standardize "Future Impacts" boxes
   - Implement consistent checkbox format
   - Add clear prerequisite markers
   - Note deferrable choices

2. Space Optimization
   - Consolidate similar choice tracking
   - Remove non-essential details
   - Use more efficient layouts
   - Stay within space allocations

3. Choice Recording
   - Standardize selection format
   - Focus on dependencies
   - Track only impactful decisions
   - Use consistent notation

4. Process Enhancement
   - Clear choice sequence
   - Prerequisite indicators
   - Dependency arrows
   - Timing requirements

### Next Steps
1. Revise section layouts for space compliance
2. Implement standardized choice format
3. Add dependency tracking
4. Test with simpler character build

### Test Status
- [x] Choice tracking tested
- [x] Space requirements evaluated
- [x] Format consistency checked
- [x] Process flow analyzed
- [ ] Changes implemented
