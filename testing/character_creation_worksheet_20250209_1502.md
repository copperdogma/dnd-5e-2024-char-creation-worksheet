<feedback_summary>
1. Structural & Sequencing Issues
   - Need to order all sections in exact PHB order for easy transcription
   - Constitution modifier needed for HP isn't available when first requested
   - AC calculation location and formula aren't clearly indicated in class section
   - Equipment sections are redundantly repeated multiple times

2. Proficiency & Source Tracking
   - Need a master section at bottom for aggregating proficiencies from all sources
   - Should use "Saving Throw Proficiencies" terminology to match PHB
   - Need more blanks for skill choices (e.g., Rogues get 4)
   - Need clear tracking of proficiency sources (class, origin, feat, etc.)

3. Simplification Needs
   - Remove unnecessary checkboxes (e.g., for class features - just write applicable ones)
   - Drop carrying capacity section (not on character sheet)
   - Remove redundant armor/weapon listings
   - Simplify species traits recording
   - Remove "Note: Actual spell selection belongs on character sheet" line
   - Consolidate language tracking into one section

4. Clarification Needs
   - Starting gold rules need verification (fixed amounts vs. dice rolls)
   - Tool type field may be unnecessary
   - Language acquisition from backgrounds needs verification
   - Species lineage/ancestry choice section needs research
   - Resource pools section needs explanation or removal

5. Key Insight
   - Each decision affects only a few downstream elements (skills, languages, stat bonuses, spells)
   - Should have master tracking section at bottom for each category
   - Players can record choices as they go, then make final decisions at end
   - This enables better auditing and prevents missing or duplicate choices

## Character Creation Sequence

### 1. Choose a Class (PHB p48-165)
**Class**: _Rogue________________ **Level**: 1 **XP**: 0

** maybe we should order all of this stuff below in the exact order it appears in the PHB? Then the player can just read and copy line by line

#### Primary Abilities
Main Ability Score(s): _Dex________________

#### Hit Points
Hit Dice: _d8____
Base HP at 1st Level: __8___ + Constitution Modifier: _____ = Total: _____
** we won't know CON modifier yet.. so maybe it shouldn't be HERE?


#### Armor Class
Base AC: _____ (write formula if special: _________________ )
** the answer to this question isn't obvious. We're in Class. Where does it say anything about your AC in class?

#### Proficiencies from Class
- Armor: __Light_______________
- Weapons: __simple + martial (finesse or light) _______________
- Tools (if any): ___Thieves' tools______________
- Saving Throws: __Dex_______________, ____Int_____________
** should be "Saving Throw Proficiencies" to match PHB
- Skills (choose _4__): ___acrobatics______________, __stealth_______________, _____perception____________, persuasion
** add another blank cuz Rogues get 4 skills
** check other classes to see what the max here is
** we need some sort of indicator that we're aggregating things for later. For instance, for proficiencies, we may get some from class, some from origin, some from feat, etc. We need to record our choices as we go and then at the end we need some way to quickly scan up the worksheet to say "now what are my final list of proficiencies I chose (and where did I get them from?)"

#### Class-Specific Choices
[ ] Fighting Style (if applicable): _________________
[ ] Subclass/Path (if applicable): _________________
[ ] Other Choice: _________________

#### Starting Equipment
Choose one:
[ ] Class Equipment Option A: _________________
[ ] Class Equipment Option B: _________________
[ ] Starting Gold (instead of equipment package):
    Class starting gold: ___d4 × 10 = _____ GP
    (Artificer/Fighter/Paladin: 5d4, Barbarian/Rogue: 4d4, Sorcerer/Wizard: 3d4)
** IS the starting gold a roll? On p129 under Rogue you have two choices: equip package OR 100GP. There's no roll.
** double check all classes: are they ALL set up with just a) equip package, or b) gold? If so reflect that in worksheet

Background Equipment (choose one):
[ ] Option A: _________________ (specific items)
[ ] Option B: 50 GP
** this seems redundant.. we just did equipment. Actually this seems like the correct one now that I see it.

#### Equipment Options & Restrictions

Armor Allowed:
[ ] Light Armor
[ ] Medium Armor
[ ] Heavy Armor
[ ] Shields
Special AC Calculations: _________________
** we already recorded this above under "Proficiencies from Class"

Weapon Categories Allowed:
[ ] Simple Weapons
[ ] Martial Weapons
[ ] Other: _________________
Special Weapon Rules: _________________
** we already recorded this above under "Proficiencies from Class"

Equipment Source Options:
1. Class Starting Equipment:
   [ ] Package A available
   [ ] Package B available
   [ ] Starting gold option (___d4 × 10 GP)
** AGAIN?

2. Background Equipment:
   [ ] Specific items available
   [ ] 50 GP option available
** AGAIN?

Carrying Capacity:
- Maximum (Str × 15): _____ lbs
- Push/Drag/Lift (Str × 30): _____ lbs
** let's drop this.. there's not even a spot to write it on the official character sheet

#### Class Features
- [ ] _expertise________________ +2 skill proficiencies
- [ ] _sneak attack________________
- [ ] __thieves' cant (language)_______________
- weapon mastery
** need more blanks, and we don't need the [ ] boxes.. we're only writing down the applicable ones in the first place.
** I'm thinking maybe we need a section that the bottom to slowly build proficiencies... Like here I get +2 skill proficiencies from expertise but it'll be hard to remember to do that later. So if we had a section at the bottom just called "proficiencies" with three portions each: source, type, proficiency (e.g.: class expertise, skill, blank for now). Then when I see that I get Rogue Expertise at first level, I can write that down, then go to the bottom and fill in two entries under proficiencies, each saying "expertise, skill, [blank]" so I know to choose them later and WHY I have them (auditing is important to make sure you don't give yourself too much/little).


#### Resource Pools
- [ ] Resource 1: _____ uses per _____
- [ ] Resource 2: _____ uses per _____
** what ARE resource pools?


#### Spellcasting (if applicable)
- Spellcasting Type: [ ] Regular [ ] Pact Magic [ ] Other _____
- Spellcasting Ability: _________________
- Number of Spells Known/Prepared: _____
- Number of Cantrips: _____

____dex_____________, _____con____________, _______cha__________

Ability Score Increases (choose one):
[ ] Option A: +2 to ___dex_____ (cannot exceed 20), +1 to ___cha_____ (cannot exceed 20)
[ ] Option B: +1 to three different scores (none can exceed 20):
    1. ________ 2. ________ 3. ________
** just put the "(none can exceed 20)" once at the top next to "choose one"

Proficiencies Gained:
- Skills: ___deception______________, __slight of hand_______________
- Tool: _____forgery kit____________ (Type: ________________)
** "Type" isn't obvious. I don't see that under background. Also do we need it? Does it fuel future decisions? Do we need to write that on the final char sheet?

- Size: [ ] Small [ ] Medium [ ] Choice between Small/Medium

** kill; this doesn't end up on the char sheet

Species Lineage/Ancestry Choice (if applicable):

- [ ] Darkvision: _____ feet
- [ ] Damage Resistance: _________________
- [ ] Proficiency Choice: _________________ from _________________

Skills:
1. __________ from: [ ]Class [ ]Background [ ]Species [ ]Feat
2. __________ from: [ ]Class [ ]Background [ ]Species [ ]Feat
(continue as needed)

Tools:
1. __________ from: [ ]Class [ ]Background [ ]Species [ ]Feat
2. __________ from: [ ]Class [ ]Background [ ]Species [ ]Feat

Languages:
1. Common (automatic)
2. __________ from: [ ]Background [ ]Species [ ]Other

Class-Specific Languages (if applicable):
[ ] Druidic (Druids only)

** note sure we need the class/special languages broken out. Just a generic list of langauges with source

#### D. Feat Details

##### Background Feat (1st Level)
Name: _________________
Category: [ ] Origin Feat
Prerequisites:
- Required Level: 1
- Ability Scores needed: _________________
- Other requirements: _________________
[ ] All prerequisites met

Mechanical Impacts:
- Ability Score Changes: _________________
- New Proficiencies: _________________
- Combat Bonuses: _________________
- Special Abilities: _________________

** same here. This entire feats thing could just be the single feat they chose for their background (or wherever they get it).
** maybe that's a good insight. Each decision only affects a few downstream things: skill proficiencies, langauges, stat bonuses, spells... is that it? If so we just have that master tracking section at the bottom with a "source" for each. As they go through their decisions they can note down at the bottom what they get and where it came from. Then as the last step they can sit down and go through that list of everything they get and make their decisions on specific skills, spells, etc. and calculate their final stats with the accumlated bonuses.
** Okay I'm going to end feedback here because we need a bunch of changes.
