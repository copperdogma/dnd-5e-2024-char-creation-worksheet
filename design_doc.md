# D&D 5e 2024 Character Creation Worksheet Design

## Section 0: How to Use This Worksheet
### Purpose
Replace the PHB's character creation chapter with a guided process that tracks choices and calculations, not final character details

### Content
- Prerequisites (PHB, dice, pencil)
- Statement that this replaces PHB character creation chapter
- Basic instructions:
  1. Print worksheet
  2. Follow each section in order
  3. Record decisions and their mechanical impacts
  4. Use boxes to track effects on later choices
  5. Transfer calculated values to character sheet when complete
- Key principles:
  - Only record choices that need processing or affect later decisions
  - For simple choices (like equipment), just note which option was selected
  - Focus on tracking the math and dependencies between choices

### Layout Notes
- Front page, clear typography
- Bullet-point format
- Estimated space: 1/3 page
