# D&D 5e 2024 Character Creation Worksheet

20250208: Created by Cam with Claude 3.5 Sonnet

## Core Purpose
Create a printable worksheet (2-3 pages) that replaces the "Creating a Character" section of the PHB by:
- Guiding players through each decision in a clear, linear order
- Providing space to record choices and their mechanical impacts
- Tracking how each choice affects future decisions
- Enabling easy transfer of final values to a character sheet

### Key Principles
- Only track information that requires intermediate work or affects later choices
- Focus on choices and calculations, not final character details
- Avoid double-recording information that can go directly to character sheet
- Include calculations and tracking where multiple sources affect final values
- Exclude detailed recording of simple choices (like equipment lists) that need no further processing

For example:
- DO track ability score calculations (multiple sources, affects other values)
- DON'T track equipment details (can go directly to character sheet)
